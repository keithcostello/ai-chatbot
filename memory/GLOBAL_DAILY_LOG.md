### ai-chatbot - Sprint S2.2-R1

**Session:** 6ca7d41e-de22-45

**Events:**
- Phase 2 (Frontend Connection) FAILED with 3 bugs (BUG-001, BUG-002, BUG-003)
- Root cause: DEV not reading requirements, not testing, PM approving without verification
- Created MICRO_PHASE_PROTOCOL.md with strict controls
- Phase 2 STOPPED - awaiting micro-phase development with user

**New Protocol Rules:**
- DEV only sees micro-phase details (not full project)
- Expert review required before code
- agent-browser verification mandatory for all AI
- Work logs must contain actual output
- User approval required at every gate
